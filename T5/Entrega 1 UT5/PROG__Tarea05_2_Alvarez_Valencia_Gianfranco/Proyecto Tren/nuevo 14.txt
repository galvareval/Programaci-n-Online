hi this is the speaking task 1.
Im my opinion the mosst important thing is to be kind to others 
because i gues that the other person will be as kind as u were with him.
thats the same reason i consider important too Say "thank you" and "please".
the second one is to show interest in the topic and person you are talking to,
 give eye contact and never interrup,i  think that all people feels bad when nobodies pay attention to then
related its to be on time, nowbody wants to lost their time wating for someone.
i consider that Hold the dooor and wathc your lenguaje in front of childdren seems greate to show your good manners

to finish the fact To be Be considerate of others while on your phone,
since no one wants to hear your conversation other than the person on the other end of the phone.
I think that this is the less important of the list
for me if someone dont want to hear your conversantion they just have to ingonre it
unleess we are in the office in this case we shouldnt do personal calls.
